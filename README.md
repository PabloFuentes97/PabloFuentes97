I'm a student from 42 Madrid TelefÃ³nica, a peer-to-peer programming school focused on project solving.

I'm currently working on a [Machine Learning mini-framework](https://github.com/PabloFuentes97/Machine-Learning-framework) build from scratch on Python.

I'm currently learning about Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Mathematics.

### Skills:

-	Main programming languages: C, C++, Python
-	Data Analysis: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, StatsModels
-	Web Backend: Django, Daphne, Django channels,asyncio, requests, websockets
-	Web Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-	Artificial Intelligence: scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras
-	Virtualization: Docker, VirtualBox
-	Relational Databases: SQL: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL
-	Scripting: Bash, Python
-	Agile methodologies: Scrum Manager

### Main areas of interest and knowledge

- Low-level development in C / C++: manual memory allocation, data structures, libraries, algorithms, graphic applications, multi-thread/multi-process programs, interactive consoles and web servers.
- Configuration, virtualization and deployment of applications (Docker, VirtualBox).
- Systems configuration and automatization (Bash, Unix / Linux).
- Web Backend development, using different frameworks (Django), protocols (HTTP, websockets) and architectures (microservices, REST APIs), and integration with relational database engines (MySQL, MariaDB, PostreSQL).
- Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.
- Videogames and graphical applications.


### Featured Projects

## Machine Learning mini-framework
Implementation built from scratch in Python of several Machine Learning models and algorithms.
-	Regressors: Linear and Polynomial Regression
-	Classifiers: Logistic Regression (Binary, One-vs-Rest), Softmax Regression
-	Neural Networks: Multilayer Perceptron
-	Optimizers: Gradient Descent (Batch, Stochastic, Mini-Batch)

## Transcendence
-	Server-side Pong: local and online matches, online tournaments and matchmaking system (Django channels, Daphne)
-	User's registration, logging and autentification (Django, PostreSQL)
-	Frontend with reactive web (JavaScript) and Command Line Interface (Python curses)
-	Microservices architecture with containers (Docker)
						           	            		      
## Inception
-	Configuration and deployment of LEMP stack (Linux, NGINX, MariaDB y Wordpress-PHP) with Docker Compose
-	Configuration from scratch of Docker images and automatized instalation of services (Bash)

## Webserv
Static HTTP web server (C++) based on NGINX
-	Reading and validation of configuration file
-	Async event loop (C poll library)
-	HTTP methods: GET, POST and DELETE
-	CGI to execute external scripts in different languages: Python and PHP

## Minishell
Interactive console (C) based on Bash				      		
-	Prompt reading and transformation to tokens list and syntax tree
-	Operators: redirections (>, >>, <, <<), pipes (|), AND (&&) and OR (||)
-	Execution of external scripts and commands, and Bash built-ins (echo, cd, export, env, unset, pwd, exit)
-	Environment variables and wildcards
